A project which simulates the ising model and investigates the effect of temperature on cluster formation 

## Article Title and Abstract
Ising model: an investigation into the effect of temperature on different cluster properties

This article will discuss a simulation of the two-dimensional Ising model.  We will use the simulation to study cluster size and compare our results to published research. We found that both the cluster size and the number of clusters can accurately be modeled by an exponential fit independent of the spin.
